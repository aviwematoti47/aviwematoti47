</p>

<p align="justify">
I am a data-driven analyst with a Bachelor of Science in Statistics and Economics and a BCom Honours in Business and Financial Analytics from the University of the Free State, where I am currently pursuing a Masterâ€™s degree in Business and Financial Analytics. My academic journey has equipped me with a robust foundation in statistical theory, econometrics, and data modeling, while nurturing a strong interest in financial research and policy analysis.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Professionally, I have applied a broad range of analytical skills across several roles. As a Research Assistant and Data Analyst at the University of the Free State, I have built and deployed machine learning models in Python to identify at-risk students, developed automated systems to monitor academic performance, and created interactive dashboards using Microsoft Power BI to support data-informed decision-making.
</p>

<p align="justify">
My role as a Junior Data Analyst at the Interdisciplinary Centre for Digital Futures (ICDF) involved managing the complete data lifecycleâ€”from collection and cleaning to analysisâ€”delivering insights that directly informed strategic planning. Additionally, my earlier experience as a Quality Assurance Assistant sharpened my attention to detail, enhanced my data validation skills, and strengthened my ability to uphold high operational standards.
</p>

<p align="justify">
I bring a research-driven mindset, critical thinking abilities, and a meticulous approach to data interpretation. My interests lie at the intersection of analytics, financial decision-making, and policy development. I am particularly drawn to interdisciplinary projects that leverage data science to solve complex challenges. I am committed to contributing impactful, evidence-based insights in both academic and applied environments.
